A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Installation 
From the application folder
- pip3 requirements
- python3 find-duplicates.py companies-short.csv 
- A data.json file with the duplicates will be generated
In case the "companies-short.csv" argument is not provided, the companies.csv will be used. During my tests, it took close to 30 minutes to find all the duplicated in the entire dataset.

A better way to present the duplicated would be generating a simple HTML file grouping the dupes in tables. This was not implemented due to time constraints.
